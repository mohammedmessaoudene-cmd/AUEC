## Abstract

This SEP specifies an **interoperability primitive**: a canonical byte form and an
append-only hash-chain construction that independent implementations produce
identically and any third party can verify, with governance-specific context
carried in registered extensions rather than in the core. What must agree across
implementations is the _bytes_, not the _semantics_ — so the construction is
specified once and referenced by many, each layer's context riding as a registered
extension on top.

The need is concrete: multiple MCP governance proposals require decisions to be
recorded in a _tamper-evident_ audit trail, but none defines what such a record is.
PR #2809 makes a tamper-evident admission record a `SHOULD` without defining the
record's shape or a shared, verifiable form for it; PR #2624 states as a compliance
consideration that audit trails "MUST" be tamper-proof, with no checkable
guarantee; caller-governance layers emit incompatible shapes. The guarantee is
named at every seam and given a shared definition at none.

This SEP defines one vendor-neutral **audit record contract**: a minimal protected
core; a type-keyed `extensions` mechanism so each layer attaches context under one
integrity construction; deterministic sorted-JSON canonicalization aligned with PR
#2809; an append-only hash chain; a verification procedure; and a structured
attestation manifest for the part that is not protocol-observable.

## Motivation

Audit is the one governance guarantee every layer asserts and none defines.
Across three independent proposals:

1. **Admission (PR #2809).** A conforming host `SHOULD` append a tamper-evident
   record for every admission decision. The proposal specifies the admission
   decision and its trust model; it does not define the record's shape or a shared,
   cross-layer verifiable form for the tamper-evident guarantee — the gap this
   contract fills.
2. **Interception / runtime security (PR #2624).** Compliance Considerations
   require that "audit trails are tamper-proof" — a deployer obligation, not a
   checked property; the proposal's own audit mechanism is non-blocking
   observability.
3. **Caller governance.** Session- and persona-scoped governance layers emit
   per-action decision records, but in shapes that vary by implementation (field
   names, what is integrity-protected, whether the record is append-only at all).

These three emit _differently shaped_ records — caller-governance carries a
declared purpose and delegating principal; runtime-security carries detections,
drift status, and data classes; admission carries the clearance decision. No
single layer's record shape is the universal one. What they share is not
a field set but a **construction**: an append-only, canonically-hashed, chained,
independently-verifiable record. Specifying that construction once — with a
minimal common core and a typed extension point for each layer's context — lets
all three _conformance-anchor to one definition_ without flattening their
differences. SEP-2484 makes a conformance check — or a documented exclusion — the
bar for Final; today the tamper-evident guarantee has no shared definition to write
a check against at any layer. Specifying the record and its verification once gives
every layer one definition to reference and one vector set to anchor to, instead of
each re-deriving and re-testing "tamper-evident" alone.

This SEP specifies that construction once. It does not move the guarantee into any
one layer; it defines an orthogonal record contract the other proposals reference
by forward-reference today and upgrade from `SHOULD` to `MUST` when this SEP lands.

## Specification

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, and
OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

This contract constrains an **audit record** and the **record chain** it belongs
to. It does not constrain the storage technology, the wire protocol used to read
records, or which governance layer authors them. Any implementation that produces
records satisfying §2.1–§2.7 and §2.9 conforms (§2.8 is reserved and out of scope
for v1), regardless of mechanism.

### 2.1 The Audit Record — Protected Core

An audit record is a structured object describing one governed event. Every
conforming record, whatever extensions it carries, MUST contain the following
**core** fields, all of which are integrity-protected (§2.4):

| Field           | Type                                                        | Requirement                                                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `event_id`      | opaque unique id                                            | MUST — unique within the chain                                                             |
| `occurred_at`   | RFC 3339 timestamp (UTC, `Z`, millisecond precision — §2.3) | MUST — assigned by the recorder's clock, MUST NOT be settable by the governed caller       |
| `principal_id`  | opaque id                                                   | MUST — the governed identity the event is attributed to                                    |
| `event_type`    | string from a registered vocabulary                         | MUST                                                                                       |
| `tool_name`     | string \| null                                              | MUST be present; null where no target applies                                              |
| `outcome`       | `allowed` \| `denied` \| `deferred` \| `error`              | MUST — the abstract disposition of the event (§2.1.1)                                      |
| `extensions`    | object keyed by registered type id                          | MUST — at least one registered extension (§2.2); at most one entry per type id             |
| `previous_hash` | hash digest \| null                                         | MUST — links to the prior record (§2.4); null only for the first record in a chain segment |
| `event_hash`    | hash digest                                                 | MUST — the integrity digest of this record (§2.4)                                          |

The core is deliberately emitter-neutral: identity, time, principal, the acted-on
target, the disposition, and the chain linkage. Layer-specific accountability
context does not belong in the core; it belongs in the `extensions` object under
a registered type id (§2.2). Implementations MUST ignore unknown **top-level**
fields rather than rejecting a record, to permit forward extension.

#### 2.1.1 The `outcome` disposition enum

`outcome` is a **closed, abstract disposition vocabulary**, not a per-layer status
code. The cross-profile anchor is the terminal/non-terminal axis:

- `allowed` — the governed event proceeded (terminal).
- `denied` — the governed event was refused (terminal).
- `deferred` — the governed event is held pending a further decision
  (non-terminal; e.g. a quarantine hold pending re-approval).
- `error` — the governance evaluation itself failed (terminal; the record SHOULD
  carry diagnostic context in an extension).

Domain-specific dispositions, reason codes, and severities MUST NOT extend this
enum; they live inside the emitting layer's extension data, bound to the base
outcome (an extension supplies decision _evidence_ that informs the core
`outcome`, never a competing outcome — e.g. a quarantine decision that holds the
event maps to `deferred`, a terminal quarantine maps to `denied`). The
classification of an `event_type` or extension field as security-relevant is
registration **prose**, not a record field — keeping it out of the digest.

### 2.2 Registered Extensions

The record contract is extended **only** through registered extensions, never
through new chain constructions. A record carries an `extensions` object — a JSON
object **keyed by registered type id**, each key's value being that extension's
typed data: `extensions: {"<type>": <data>, ...}`. Extension data is canonicalized
into the same preimage as the core (§2.3) and is therefore integrity-protected by
the same chain — there is exactly one chain construction, shared across all
extensions, and the type id is itself a preimage _key_, so an extension's type
cannot be swapped without breaking verification.

Structural rules:

- A conforming record MUST carry **at least one** registered extension (the
  emitting layer's own context) and MAY carry several — e.g. a caller-governance
  record that also carries runtime-security evidence chains both under one digest.
- The keyed-object form makes a duplicate type structurally unrepresentable: at
  most one entry per type id, keys sorted by the same every-level key-sort as the
  rest of the record (§2.3).
- Type ids are **flat names from a curated registry** (the IANA-media-type
  pattern), not a permissionless namespace; reverse-DNS-style ids are not used.
  Type ids and registered field names form a controlled ASCII registry vocabulary
  (§2.3).

An extension registration defines: the type id; its REQUIRED and OPTIONAL data
fields and their types (and any closed value vocabularies); the `event_type`
vocabulary it recognizes (§2.9); and how its decision evidence binds to the core
`outcome` (§2.1.1). A record's data for each declared extension MUST satisfy that
registration's required fields.

This SEP registers and fully specifies one extension, records the converged shape
of a second whose normative registration text is contributed by its implementer,
and **names** a third contributed by reference:

- **`caller-governance`** (specified here). REQUIRED: `purpose_declared` (the
  declared purpose/intent captured at event time). OPTIONAL: `session_id`,
  `invoked_by_principal_id` (the delegating principal), `flagged`,
  `sources_touched`, `sensitivity_encountered`, `output_disposition`,
  `human_actor_id`.
- **`runtime-security`** — converged shape; **normative registration text
  contributed by Maaz (Interlock), the runtime-security implementer** (final text
  2026-06-14; cross-ref PR #2624), who independently reproduced the two-extension
  known-answer digest from the published rule. The `runtime-security` object summarizes a
  runtime policy disposition for the event and composes with other extension
  bodies without interaction. **All values defined by this profile MUST be JSON
  strings** (no numeric, boolean, `null`, array, or nested-object values), keeping
  the body within the base record's string-only canonicalization and outside any
  number-canonicalization concern (a profile convention, not a core rule — §2.3).
  Fields:
  - `drift_status` (REQUIRED, string enum) — the runtime's evidentiary state
    regarding tool-surface drift: `none` (no drift relative to the approved
    surface evidenced), `observed` (a change evidenced, without a determination
    that it is policy-relevant), `confirmed` (a policy-relevant change evidenced).
    A consumer that does not recognize a value MUST treat the field as absent (no
    claim made), not infer a default.
  - `severity` (REQUIRED, string enum) — `info` | `low` | `medium` | `high`, in
    non-decreasing order of severity. Numeric scores are out of scope for this
    extension and MUST NOT be carried in the canonical body.
  - `quarantine_decision` (REQUIRED, string enum) — the disposition the runtime
    applied: `release` (permitted to proceed), `hold` (held pending review),
    `quarantine`.
  - `policy_id` (REQUIRED, string) — identifies the policy that produced the
    disposition, of the form `<scope>/<name>@<revision>`, where `<scope>` is an
    emitter-qualified namespace (e.g. a reverse-DNS name, a URN, or a registered
    prefix) sufficient to disambiguate the policy across emitters. It is
    vendor-neutral: it names a policy, not a product, an engine, or a detection
    method (e.g. `example.org/runtime-drift@3`).
  - `evidence_hash` (OPTIONAL, string) — when present, a cryptographic digest
    expressed as `<algorithm>:<hex>` (e.g. `sha256:<hex>`) committing to an
    out-of-band evidence record. It is an opaque commitment only: this contract
    does not inline the evidence, prescribe its schema, or require any particular
    detection method, and the base record commits to it as opaque bytes without
    verifying it; a consumer wishing to rely on the evidence resolves and verifies
    it out of band. OPTIONAL because a `drift_status: none` event may have nothing
    to commit to.

  **Outcome binding (§2.1.1):** the disposition is decision _evidence_ informing
  the base `outcome`, never a competing or independent outcome field; the base
  `outcome` MUST reflect the actual enforcement result. A confirmed drift with
  `quarantine_decision: quarantine` held pending review maps to `outcome:
deferred` (as in the `/2` conformance fixture); a terminally-blocked disposition
  maps to `outcome: denied`. Other combinations follow the base record's outcome
  semantics. (This prevents a record whose base outcome is `allowed` from
  simultaneously carrying a `quarantine` disposition: the extension explains
  _why_; the base outcome states _what happened_.)

- **`admission-control`** (named; field set contributed — the clearance decision
  and its inputs). Cross-ref PR #2809.

New extensions are added by registration without altering §2.1, §2.3, or §2.4. An
extension MUST NOT redefine a core field or introduce a second canonicalization.

### 2.3 Canonicalization

Integrity (§2.4) is computed over a **deterministic canonical form** of the
record's protected fields (the core minus `event_hash`, plus the full
`extensions` object). The canonical form is **sorted-key canonical JSON**, aligned
with the canonicalization used by PR #2809's clearance assertion so that adopters
process clearance assertions and audit records on one code path and one vector
matrix. A canonicalization MUST:

- **Sort object keys** lexicographically at every level, including the
  `extensions` object and each extension's nested data, and serialize with no
  insignificant whitespace.
- **Canonicalize extensions in the type-keyed object form**
  `extensions:{"<type>":<data>, ...}` — this exact representation is the
  preimage. Implementations MUST NOT substitute an alternative representation
  (e.g. an array of `{type, data}` pairs): different representations of the same
  content produce different digests, and the keyed object is what makes
  one-entry-per-type structurally unrepresentable and rides the same key-sort
  with no special-case rule.
- **Restrict protected values to strings, booleans, and `null`** — each of which
  has exactly one canonical JSON form. **Bare numbers are excluded** from
  protected bodies in this version (`1` vs `1.0` vs `1e0` have no agreed single
  form; a number-canonicalization rule is deferred to a later version — encode
  numeric content as a string in the meantime). `null` is part of the core form
  (every segment head carries `previous_hash: null`); booleans serialize as
  `true`/`false`. An extension MAY adopt a stricter all-strings convention for
  its own data (runtime-security does), but that is the extension's convention,
  not a core rule.
- **Encode null distinguishably from empty string** (`null` vs `""`).
- **Serialize `occurred_at` as RFC 3339 in UTC with millisecond precision and a
  literal `Z`** (the `Date.toISOString()` form, e.g. `2026-06-02T12:00:00.000Z`),
  so timestamp digests are reproducible across implementations regardless of the
  recorder's native timestamp storage.
- **Normalize protected string values** to bound the coupling of integrity to
  free-text fields: Unicode **NFC**, **trim leading/trailing U+0020 (ASCII space)
  only**, reject **control characters**, and enforce a **length cap** (baseline
  8192 code units). A protected string failing normalization makes the record
  non-conforming. The trim charset is deliberately **U+0020 only**, not the full
  Unicode whitespace class: ASCII space is the only commonly-accidental edge
  whitespace, while non-control Unicode whitespace (NBSP U+00A0, the U+2000–U+200A
  range, ideographic space U+3000, etc.) is preserved as significant content.
  Naming the charset is load-bearing for cross-implementation reproducibility — an
  unqualified "trim" diverges across implementations (SQL `btrim(x, ' ')` strips
  U+0020 only; a typical host `.trim()` strips the full whitespace class). Control
  characters — including the C0 set (tab U+0009, LF U+000A, CR U+000D) — are
  **rejected**, not trimmed; a leading or trailing control character renders the
  record non-conforming rather than being stripped.
  **Registry vocabulary is exempt:** extension type ids and registered field
  names are a controlled ASCII registry vocabulary (§2.2) and pass through the
  canonical form verbatim — they are object _keys_, not values, and the registry
  (not normalization) is what constrains them. The exemption is safe precisely
  because the vocabulary is registry-controlled ASCII; an unregistered type id is
  non-conforming under C-REC-1 regardless of its bytes.
- **Exclude `event_hash`** (the output) and the reserved `anchor_witness` (§2.8,
  unused in v1) from the canonical body.

The canonical form is identical across extensions; only the data each type id
keys differs. A fixed two-extension known-answer test — one record carrying both
`caller-governance` and `runtime-security`, reproducible from a shell with
`sha256sum` — pins how two extensions hash side by side. (The fixed value, with
its canonical preimage, is given under Conformance; the companion vectors reproduce
it and the full matrix programmatically.)

### 2.4 Integrity Construction (Record Chain)

Records form an append-only **hash chain**. For each record:

- `event_hash` MUST equal `H( canonical_form( protected_body ) )`, where `H` is a
  collision-resistant hash function, `canonical_form` is §2.3, and `protected_body`
  is the core (less `event_hash`) plus the full `extensions` object, and includes
  the record's own `previous_hash`.
- `previous_hash` MUST equal the `event_hash` of the immediately preceding record
  in the chain segment, or null for the first record in a segment.

`H` MUST be SHA-256 at baseline. An implementation MAY use a stronger function;
the function in use MUST be recorded in the attestation manifest (§2.7) so a
verifier is unambiguous (algorithm agility). Implementations MUST NOT use a hash
function with a known practical collision.

A chain "segment" is a contiguous run of records over which `previous_hash`
threading is continuous. Implementations MAY segment chains (e.g. per time window
or partition); each segment MUST be independently verifiable and the segmentation
boundary MUST be discoverable to a verifier.

### 2.5 Append-Only Requirement

Once committed to the chain, a record MUST NOT be modified or deleted by any
caller — including a privileged operator — without that alteration being
detectable by the verification procedure (§2.6). Concretely:

- The record store MUST reject in-place UPDATE and DELETE of committed records
  through its normal access paths.
- Any out-of-band alteration (e.g. by a database superuser) MUST change the
  altered record's canonical form and therefore break chain verification at or
  after the altered record.

The _enforcement mechanism_ is implementation-defined and is explicitly NOT
constrained by this SEP; it is declared in the attestation manifest (§2.7).
Conforming mechanisms include, and are not limited to: storage-engine permission
revocation plus row-level policy denying mutation; write-once media; an
append-only log service; or a ledger.

### 2.6 Verification Procedure

A conforming chain MUST be verifiable by an independent party in possession of the
records, by the following procedure:

1. For each record, recompute `H( canonical_form( protected_body ) )` and compare
   it to the stored `event_hash`. A mismatch indicates the record was altered
   after commitment (in any protected field, core **or** extension).
2. For each record after the first in a segment, confirm `previous_hash` equals
   the prior record's `event_hash`. A mismatch indicates insertion, deletion, or
   reordering.

The procedure runs identically whether executed by an adopter attesting to its own
trail or by a third party with read access to an exported record set. It MUST be
deterministic: the same record set MUST always produce the same verdict.

### 2.7 Attestation Manifest (Structured Attestation)

The append-only _enforcement_ of §2.5 is a storage property, not a wire-observable
one — so gating it at the protocol surface would be theater. It is therefore
**attested**, but attestation MUST be _structured_: a bare "trust us" claim is not
conformant. A conforming implementation MUST publish a machine-readable
**attestation manifest** declaring:

- `storage_mechanism` — the append-only enforcement mechanism (§2.5).
- `chain_algorithm` — the hash function in use (§2.4).
- `canonical_form_version` — the canonicalization version (§2.3).
- `verification_procedure_ref` — a resolvable pointer to a reproducible
  implementation of §2.6 that runs over an exported record set and emits a
  deterministic pass/fail verdict.

The machine-checkable vectors (the companion vector set) verify the observable record (schema, extension
validity, canonical form, chain threading, emission). The manifest plus the
referenced verifier make the integrity construction **attested-but-auditable**
rather than attested-in-the-abstract: a reviewer can re-run the declared
verification over the records and reproduce the verdict.

### 2.8 External Anchoring (Reserved; Out of Scope for v1)

Anchoring a chain to an external witness (e.g. RFC 3161 timestamp, version-control
commit, object-store checksum, public ledger) addresses a distinct, weaker-priority
threat — an _auditing organization_ rewriting its own history — that is orthogonal
to the within-system chain construction. Selecting a witness scheme is deferred to
avoid binding v1 to an ecosystem pick.

A field name `anchor_witness` is **reserved** for this purpose. In v1 it MUST be
absent or null and is NOT included in the integrity preimage (§2.3); a follow-on
anchoring extension defines its semantics and whether it enters the preimage.
Anchoring's absence MUST NOT affect conformance to §2.1–§2.7.

### 2.9 Emission Completeness

This SEP defines the _record_ and its _construction_, not the policy of which
events a given governance layer must record — that belongs to each referencing
proposal / extension registration. A referencing proposal that adopts this
contract:

- MUST define the set of `event_type` values it requires to be recorded and the
  conditions under which each is emitted;
- MUST record each such event as a conforming record (§2.1–§2.4);
- and the recording of an event MUST NOT fail the governed operation's response
  path solely because record emission failed (audit emission is non-blocking; a
  failed emission MUST itself be detectable, e.g. recorded as an error record or
  surfaced out-of-band).

## Rationale

**Why a separate record contract, rather than audit inside each layer.** Audit is
asserted at several seams (admission, interception/runtime-security,
caller-governance) and given a shared, verifiable definition at none; each names
the guarantee without defining a record shape the others can verify against. What
those layers share is not a field set but a
_construction_ — an append-only, canonically-hashed, chained, independently
verifiable record. Specifying that construction once, with a minimal common core
and a typed extension point per layer, lets all of them conformance-anchor to one
definition without flattening their differences. This follows the project's
convergence principle (one well-defined way to solve a problem) rather than
fragmenting audit across N incompatible shapes.

**Key design decisions and alternatives considered.**

- **Type-keyed `extensions` object, not a `{type, data}` array.** The keyed-object
  form makes a duplicate extension type structurally unrepresentable, makes the
  type id a preimage _key_ (so an extension's type cannot be swapped without
  breaking verification), and rides the same every-level key-sort with no
  special-case rule. An array form was rejected: different representations of the
  same content produce different digests, and the array invites duplicate-type and
  ordering ambiguity.
- **Protected values restricted to string / boolean / null; no bare numbers.**
  Each of these has exactly one canonical JSON form. Bare numbers (`1` vs `1.0` vs
  `1e0`) have no agreed single form; rather than bind v1 to a number-canonicalization
  scheme, numeric content is encoded as a string and a number rule is deferred to a
  later canonical-form version. The stricter all-strings convention adopted by the
  runtime-security extension is its own profile choice, not a core rule.
- **Abstract `outcome` enum, not per-layer status codes.** A closed disposition
  vocabulary (`allowed`/`denied`/`deferred`/`error`) keyed on the
  terminal/non-terminal axis stays stable across profiles; domain-specific reason
  codes and severities live in extension data and bind to the base outcome as
  _evidence_, never as a competing outcome. This keeps the cross-profile anchor
  fixed while letting each layer carry its own semantics.
- **Attested-but-structured append-only enforcement, not wire-gating and not
  "trust us".** Append-only _enforcement_ (§2.5) is a storage property, not a
  protocol-observable one; gating it at the wire would be theater. A bare "trust
  us" attestation is non-conformant. The chosen middle path is a machine-readable
  attestation manifest plus a referenced, reproducible verifier that re-runs over
  an exported record set — so a reviewer can reproduce the verdict without the
  guarantee depending on an unobservable claim.
- **Sorted-JSON canonicalization aligned with PR #2809, not a new canonicalizer.**
  Adopters process clearance assertions and audit records on one code path and one
  vector matrix; alignment, not a blocking dependency.
- **Trim charset is U+0020 only, not the full Unicode whitespace class.** Naming
  the charset is load-bearing for cross-implementation reproducibility: an
  unqualified "trim" diverges (`btrim(x, ' ')` strips ASCII space only; a typical
  host `.trim()` strips the full class). Non-control Unicode whitespace is
  preserved as significant content; control characters are rejected, not trimmed.
- **External anchoring reserved, out of scope for v1.** Anchoring to an external
  witness addresses a distinct, weaker-priority threat and would bind v1 to an
  ecosystem pick; a reserved `anchor_witness` hook leaves the door open without
  committing the core.

**Evidence of community process.** The contract was developed in the MCP Security
Interest Group (`#security-ig`) with the author of the admission proposal (PR
#2809) and the runtime-security implementer, Syed Maaz Ahmed (Interlock; cross-ref
PR #2624). The `runtime-security` extension's normative registration text was
contributed by Maaz rather than authored top-down. The two-extension known-answer digest
reproduces byte-for-byte from the published rule plus stock `sha256sum` across
independent implementations — the cross-implementation agreement the construction
is meant to produce.

**On the "make it an extension" question.** A reasonable reading of the project's
composability and standardization principles is "build audit on top, as an
extension, rather than in the specification." This contract is positioned as an
_interoperability primitive_ — a canonical byte form that independent
implementations must agree on for cross-vendor verification — not as a protocol
feature or as governance-in-core. The governance semantics ride in registered
extensions, off the core; the only thing standardized is the construction multiple
layers already converge on. Positioned this way, the record contract is the
cross-cutting _evidence_ layer beneath the other proposals: admission (#2809)
decides whether a server may be used, interception/runtime-security (#2624) decides
whether an admitted surface drifted, and caller-governance decides whether a caller
may invoke — three different decisions, all three needing the _same_ tamper-evident
record to be accountable. Standardizing that record once is what lets the three
compose without each re-inventing "tamper-evident"; it is the interop seam between
them, not a governance feature competing with any of them.

## Backward Compatibility

This SEP is purely additive and introduces no backward incompatibilities.

- **No existing MCP message changes shape.** The contract defines an orthogonal
  record and its verification; it adds no new wire messages and no changes to
  existing schemas, and it does not dictate a database engine, transport, or runtime
  architecture. The record and its verification are off-wire (evaluated over an
  exported record set), so there is no protocol-surface incompatibility. An
  implementation that does not adopt the contract is unaffected, and an unextended
  host or server behaves exactly as today.
- **Effect on referencing proposals is opt-in and non-breaking.**
  - _Admission (PR #2809)._ A proposal whose tamper-evident admission record is a
    `SHOULD` MAY, if this SEP lands, forward-reference it and upgrade that obligation
    to a `MUST` at its own discretion; the canonicalization here is the sorted-JSON
    form already used by #2809's clearance assertion, not a new one.
  - _Runtime security (PR #2624)._ This contract supplies the checkable record shape
    that #2624 states as a compliance consideration; adopting it requires no change
    to an engine's existing runtime enforcement.
    Until a referencing proposal chooses to upgrade, nothing changes for it.
- **Forward-compatible versioning.** Layer-specific context is isolated in the
  type-keyed `extensions` object, so new profiles register without altering the
  core. The canonical-form version is carried in the attestation manifest (§2.7),
  not in the hashed bytes, so a later canonicalization revision (for example, adding
  number canonicalization, or activating the reserved `anchor_witness` hook, §2.8)
  can be introduced as a new canonical-form version without invalidating chains
  produced under an earlier one.
- **No deprecations.** This SEP removes or deprecates nothing.

## Conformance

Conformance is split along what is protocol-observable, consistent with SEP-2484's
documented-exclusion model.

**Machine-checkable (vectors provided).** Given a set of records and a manifest:

- C-REC-1 — every record carries the §2.1 core with conforming types and a
  legal `outcome` disposition (§2.1.1); its `extensions` object carries at least
  one registered type id, no unregistered type ids, and each extension's data
  satisfies its registration's required fields and closed vocabularies.
- C-REC-2 — the canonical form (§2.3) is deterministic, injective over the
  protected body (core **and** extension data), uses the mandated type-keyed
  `extensions` representation, restricts protected values to string/bool/null
  (no bare numbers), normalizes equivalent strings, and rejects control
  characters; null encodes distinguishably from empty string; registry
  vocabulary (type ids, registered field names) passes through verbatim.
- C-REC-3 — `event_hash` equals the hash of the canonical form of the protected
  body (§2.4), including a fixed known-answer test for cross-implementation
  interop — among them a **two-extension** record pinning how multiple
  extensions hash side by side.
- C-REC-4 — `previous_hash` threading is continuous within a segment; a mutated or
  removed record is detected (§2.6) — including mutation of an extension field such
  as `purpose_declared`.
- C-REC-5 — declared-required `event_type` values are present for a scripted
  sequence of governed events (§2.9).
- C-REC-6 — the extension mechanism is emitter-neutral: records carrying
  different (and multiple) extensions chain under one construction, and extension
  data is integrity-protected by the same chain.
- C-REC-7 — the attestation manifest (§2.7) is structured (declares mechanism,
  algorithm, canonical-form version, and a verification-procedure pointer); a bare
  attestation is non-conformant.

A normative, runnable vector set for C-REC-1…7 is published with the reference
implementation, in the GIF repository under
`mcp-server/conformance/audit-record-contract/`
(https://github.com/notboatanchor/gif/tree/e1f02a95506e81e7766c3ba3a684ecad7cfff12f/mcp-server/conformance/audit-record-contract).
From `mcp-server/`, `npm run vectors` yields `23 vectors — 23 passed, 0 failed`
(zero-dependency alternative:
`node --experimental-strip-types conformance/audit-record-contract/run.ts`). Because the
integrity guarantee is off-wire (§2.7), these are record/verifier vectors evaluated
over an exported record set — not wire-protocol scenarios — providing the
machine-checkable evidence SEP-2484 requires for Final, paired with the structured
attestation (§2.7) for the part that is not protocol-observable.

**Two-extension known-answer test (self-contained).** The cross-implementation
interop anchor referenced in C-REC-3 is fixed here so it can be reproduced with no
repository and no dependence on any implementation — a single segment-head record
(`previous_hash: null`) carrying both registered extensions, pinning how two
extensions hash side by side under one digest. The identifiers are vendor-neutral
constants; `event_hash` is the computed output and is excluded from the preimage.

The canonical form (§2.3) of the protected body is the exact byte string:

```
{"event_id":"99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999","event_type":"tool_call","extensions":{"caller-governance":{"flagged":false,"invoked_by_principal_id":null,"purpose_declared":"reconcile June invoices","session_id":"55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555"},"runtime-security":{"drift_status":"confirmed","evidence_hash":"sha256:b2c547e2c8f17eafc72ef5c2d4d7b6b4d0f7437ab52bae573a9af14ff5e2d9be","policy_id":"example.org/runtime-drift@3","quarantine_decision":"quarantine","severity":"high"}},"occurred_at":"2026-06-06T12:00:00.000Z","outcome":"deferred","previous_hash":null,"principal_id":"aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa","tool_name":"export"}
```

whose SHA-256 is:

```
f733fed9cc757165f810b778e4baba1f51a45504988e937707aaab4361b2f064
```

Reproduce from any shell — paste the preimage block above between the quotes:

```
printf '%s' '<canonical preimage above>' | sha256sum
# -> f733fed9cc757165f810b778e4baba1f51a45504988e937707aaab4361b2f064
```

Because the digest is a property of the canonical bytes alone, any implementation
adopting §2.3 lands on the same value. The published vector set additionally pins
the single-extension `caller-governance` digest (`d494769c…`) and the full
C-REC-1…7 matrix.

**Attested-but-structured (not protocol-observable).** The append-only
_enforcement_ of §2.5 is attested via §2.7. A conformance harness verifies the
_consequence_ (chain verification fails after an out-of-band mutation, C-REC-4)
and the _structure_ of the attestation (C-REC-7), rather than the storage
mechanism itself.

## Open Questions

(The design decisions resolved during #security-ig review — extension
representation, canonical form, the outcome vocabulary, value types, and the
attested-but-structured verification surface — are recorded in the Rationale's
"Key design decisions and alternatives considered.")

- **Q-A — Normative registration text for `admission-control`.** The
  `runtime-security` registration was contributed by its implementer and is folded
  into §2.2; `admission-control` remains contributed by reference (PR #2809). This
  SEP fixes the mechanism and the `caller-governance` extension.
- **Q-B — Anchoring extension.** Semantics of the reserved `anchor_witness`
  (§2.8), deferred to a follow-on.
- **Q-C — Number, sponsor, and venue.** Homed under #security-ig; a formal PR
  cross-references PR #2809 and PR #2624. Sponsor being secured.

## Security Implications

A hash chain provides tamper-_evidence_, not tamper-_prevention_: it guarantees
that alteration of committed records is _detectable_, not impossible. Detection
depends on at least one trustworthy copy of a prior `event_hash` — the motivation
for the reserved external-anchor hook (§2.8) against adversaries who can reach the
record store. Because `purpose_declared` and other extension fields are inside the
chain (§2.2), the privileged-actor-rewrites-intent vector is closed: altering a
recorded reason breaks verification. The integrity guarantee is only as strong as
the protected field set; fields an extension registration chooses to leave out of
its data object are unprotected. Timestamps are recorder-assigned (§2.1) to
prevent a governed
caller from backdating records. String normalization (§2.3) bounds — but does not
eliminate — the risk of homoglyph/encoding ambiguity in free-text fields; it does
not address confidentiality of record contents, which may carry sensitive
governance context and SHOULD be access-controlled independently of integrity
protection. A verifier processing records from an untrusted source SHOULD bound
canonicalization (§2.3) recursion depth: deeply-nested input is otherwise a
stack-exhaustion vector, and conforming records are shallow, so a generous cap
rejects only hostile input (the reference verifier caps depth accordingly).

## Reference Implementation

An open-source reference implementation of this construction exists: the Governed
Intelligence Framework (Apache 2.0, `https://github.com/notboatanchor/gif`). It
implements the **core + chain construction + the `caller-governance` context**.
Its canonical form matches this contract's rule (sorted-JSON, millisecond RFC 3339
timestamps, `purpose_declared` in the preimage). It implements this draft's
`extensions` keyed-object shape (`canon_version = gif-audit/2`, migration 015; the
predecessor single-profile shape `gif-audit/1` merged in gif PR #28). Its audit
trigger emits and reproduces the **single-extension** `caller-governance`
known-answer digest (`d494769c…`) as its own self-test; the **two-extension**
digest (`f733fed9…`, given under Conformance) is reproduced by the same canonical
rule over the published preimage — and exercised synthetically in the conformance
vectors — rather than minted by the live trigger. This is consistent with the
digest being a property of the canonical bytes, not of any one implementation: a
second implementer (the runtime-security implementation, cross-ref PR #2624)
independently reproduced it from the rule alone. It produces caller-bound,
append-only, SHA-256 hash-chained audit records; enforces append-only at the
storage layer via privilege revocation plus row-level policy and a trusted hashing
trigger; and ships runnable conformance scenarios for record emission, append-only
behavior, and scope-gated read. Per the spec-vs-source discipline, the reference
implementation does strictly more than this contract requires (it binds records to
a persona/session governance model and a scope system not specified here), and the
contract is written to admit implementation paths other than the reference one
(storage engine, enforcement mechanism, and every extension beyond
caller-governance are open).

Independent implementations of the **same construction** under other extensions
exist — a runtime-security receipt (cross-ref PR #2624) and an admission record
(cross-ref PR #2809) — which is the intended outcome: the construction is the
invariant, the extension is the variation, and multiple implementation paths
anchor to one definition.

## Acknowledgments

This contract was developed in the open in the MCP Security Interest Group
(`#security-ig`). The `admission-control` extension is named by reference to the
Attested Tool-Server Admission proposal (ATSA, PR #2809).
